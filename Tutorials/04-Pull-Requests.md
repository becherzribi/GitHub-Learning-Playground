### Pull Request Fundamentals
- Mechanism for code review and collaboration
- Propose changes to a repository
- Request merging of one branch into another
- Enable team discussion before integration

### Pull Request Metaphor

- Decision made on code quality and fit

## 🔍 Pull Request Workflow

### Typical Pull Request Steps
1. Fork repository
2. Create feature branch
3. Make changes
4. Push branch to repository

6. Code review process
7. Address feedback
8. Merge or reject

## 💻 Pull Request Components

### Pull Request Anatomy
- **Title**: Concise change description
- **Description**: Detailed explanation
- **Commits**: Individual code changes
- **Diff View**: Side-by-side code comparison
- **Comments**: Team discussion area
