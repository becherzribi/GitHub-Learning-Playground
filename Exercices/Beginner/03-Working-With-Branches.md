# 🌳 Git Branching: Workflow Exploration

## 🎯 Exercise Objective
Master the art of creating, switching, and managing Git branches.

## 🚀 Branch Navigation Mission
- [ ] 🆕 Create new branches
- [ ] 🔀 Switch between branches
- [ ] 📋 List existing branches
- [ ] 🧩 Understand branch workflow
- [ ] 🔍 Merge branch changes

## 📋 Branch Challenge Roadmap
| Stage | 🌟 Task | 💡 Key Skill |
