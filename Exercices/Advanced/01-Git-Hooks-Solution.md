# 🏆 Git Hooks: Comprehensive Automation Solution

## 🚀 Detailed Git Hooks Implementation Walkthrough

### 1. 🌐 Project Setup
```bash
# 🆕 Create project
mkdir git-hooks-demo
cd git-hooks-demo
git init

# 📝 Initialize project structure
mkdir src tests
touch src/main.py tests/test_main.py
```

### 2. 🪝 Pre-Commit Hook Creation
```bash
# 🔧 Create pre-commit hook
mkdir -p .git/hooks
touch .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit

# 📝 Pre-commit hook script
cat > .git/hooks/pre-commit << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash

# Run linter
pylint src/*.py

# Run tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Prevent commit if checks fail
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Commit failed: Please fix linting and test issues"
    exit 1
fi
EOF
```

### 3. 🧪 Sample Project Files
```python
# src/main.py
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

# tests/test_main.py
from src.main import add_numbers

def test_add_numbers():
    assert add_numbers(2, 3) == 5
```

### 4. 🔍 Hook Configuration
```bash
# 📋 Additional configuration
git config --local core.hooksPath .git/hooks
```
